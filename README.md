# WSampler
A simple and lightweight Python made UTAU voicebank configuration tool. Similar to Set-Param.
This was made as an experiment on coding, PLEASE do NOT take it seriously, i am pretty new to coding.

## What this tool does.
- Configurates oto.ini's.

## Installation.

Make sure you have Python installed, no matter what version.
Make sure you install all what the pip install says !!.

## Usage.
- Click the exe.
- Set your voice/wavs folder.
- Drag the colored bars, they are draggeable.
- You must have an oto.ini, you can generate one with Moresampler tho.

```
pip install numpy matplotlib pydub tkinter
```
you will ALSO NEED FFMPEG installed and added to PATH
After this, now you can execute the exe.
